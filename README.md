🚀 Synapse Chrome Extension
A Chrome extension to help users stay productive by blocking distracting websites during focus sessions.

✨ Features

✅ Focus Mode controlled via Firebase Realtime Database
✅ Whitelist domains — allow certain sites during focus mode
✅ Blocklist domains — block specific sites during focus mode
✅ Overlay popup when a blocked site is opened — user must provide a reason
✅ Distraction logs saved locally (with timestamp)
✅ Dynamic User ID Generation — generates a unique 16-character user ID stored locally for personalized Firebase interactions
✅ Modern UI with tabs for Whitelist and Blocklist


🛠 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/focus-mode-extension.git
cd focus-mode-extension

2️⃣ Set up Firebase

Go to Firebase Console
Create a project (if you don’t have one)
Enable Realtime Database
Copy your web app config
👉 In env.js, rename env.example.js and replace the config object with your Firebase credentials:

export const FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DB_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

3️⃣ Load the extension into Chrome

Open Chrome → chrome://extensions/
Enable Developer Mode (toggle at the top right)
Click Load unpacked
Select the directory where you cloned this project

4️⃣ Set up your Firebase paths
✅ The extension auto-creates:
/users/{USER_ID}/settings/focusMode
/users/{USER_ID}/distractions

where {USER_ID} is a dynamically generated 16-character hash stored in chrome.storage.local.
5️⃣ Add domains to whitelist/blocklist

Click the extension icon → manage Whitelist & Blocklist
Add/remove domains as needed

6️⃣ Test

Enable focus mode by setting /users/{USER_ID}/settings/focusMode = true in Firebase
Try opening a blocked site
Overlay popup appears → enter reason → tab closes → reason logged
Right-click extension icon → Show Logs → view logs
